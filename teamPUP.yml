  Our project is a command-line interactive version of the game Mancala.
  It supports two-player gameplay and additionally allows users to play
  against a computer AI in a single-player mode, with four difficulty levels
  to choose from. The interface keeps track of the winner for each round and 
  provides an option to continue gameplay by prompting to play again.
